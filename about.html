            <h2>From a high school blogger to a software engineer.</h2>

            <p>Hey there, I'm Nurul. Let me share my journey with you</p>
            <p>
              Back in high school, I was exploring different interests, just
              like any other teenager. But what set me apart was my passion for
              blogging. Instead of the usual teenage gossip, I found myself
              pouring my thoughts and poetry onto the digital page. It was my
              little corner of the internet where I could express myself freely.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020, a group of friends and I decided to take on a business
              plan competition. Our idea? A marketing agency. And guess what? I
              was the one who took charge of building and managing our website.
              Armed with determination and a willingness to learn, I dove into
              the world of web development, teaching myself the ins and outs of
              WordPress along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Managing the agency's website was both challenging and rewarding.
              It gave me firsthand experience in the world of technology and
              sparked my curiosity about what else I could create.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came 2021, a year that changed everything. That's when I
              discovered coding, and let me tell you, it was love at first
              sight. From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I was
              hooked. It felt like unlocking a whole new world of possibilities,
              and I couldn't get enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. It was challenging,
              frustrating even, but I kept at it. I took online courses, joined
              coding communities, and slowly but surely, things started to
              click.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, as I stand here, reflecting on my journey, I see how far I've
              come. From a high school blogger to the one who built and managed
              a marketing agency's website to becoming a software engineer, each
              step has shaped me in profound ways. And while the road ahead may
              be uncertain, one thing is clear: I'm ready to tackle whatever
              challenges come my way, armed with determination and a genuine
              love for all things tech.
