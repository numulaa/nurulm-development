              I am a Software Engineer based in Indonesia. I am proficient in
              both Frontend development and Backend development. I have
              extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.Js, MongoDB,
              and React. As a software engineer, I craft robust, scalable
              software with an entrepreneurial mindset and relentless hustle.
              Driven by a passion for innovation, I focus on improving the
              customer experience, shaping the digital landscape one line of
              code at a time.

            <h2>From chaos to systems.</h2>

            <p>Hey there, I'm Nurul. Let me share my journey with you</p>
            <p>
              My love for technology began when I was in high school. Not just
              for fun, but to solve problems
            </p>
            <p>
              In high school, I spent my time volunteering to teach children
              outside of school. Every child had different needs—some needed
              help with math homework, others needed new books or backpacks. We
              kept track manually, but it quickly became chaotic. Notes got
              lost, requests piled up, and we struggled to organize who needed
              what and who could help.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I built a solution: a volunteer coordination app. Instead of
              scattered notes, we had a system where volunteers could log each
              child’s needs and mark which ones they could fulfill. Suddenly,
              our efforts were more organized, efficient, and impactful—we could
              help more kids, faster, with less confusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then in college, I took on something even bigger: leading a coin
              collection project for charity. What started as a small initiative
              to gather spare change for scholarships quickly turned into an
              organizational nightmare. Friends kept calling, eager to donate,
              but coordinating pickups became overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I built another solution: a coin pickup scheduling app. Donors
              could schedule a time, and volunteers could be assigned pickups,
              making the entire process seamless. The result? More donations,
              less hassle, and a scalable system that worked effortlessly. Our
              efforts paid off—we successfully funded scholarships for three
              students for an entire semester.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s when I realized:
              <strong
                >Technology is my superpower for solving real-world
                inefficiencies.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              I took that mindset into my tech career, working as a frontend
              engineer, building scalable web applications. I developed
              real-time apps, interactive platforms, and automation tools—always
              with the goal of making processes smoother and more intuitive.
              Whether it was helping a nursing home streamline communication,
              building a job board for better hiring transparency, or creating
              tools to enhance digital accessibility, my focus remained the
              same:
            </p>
            <p>
              Turn chaos into systems. Use tech to empower people. Make an
              impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I bring that same mindset to solving real-world
              inefficiencies. Where is your organization struggling? What
              repetitive, frustrating process is slowing you down? Let’s fix
              it—with technology that works for you, not against you.
