            <h2>From a high school blogger to a software engineer.</h2>

            <p>Hey there, I'm Nurul. Let me share my journey with you</p>
            <p>
              My journey with technology began when I was a child, and I was
              first introduced to computers at the age of five. From that
              moment, I was hooked. The fascination grew as I discovered that I
              could create things on the computer, which led me to explore
              programming, design, and eventually, web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in web development, focusing
              on both frontend and backend technologies. I’ve worked extensively
              with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js, and have
              developed a passion for animation and immersive experiences using
              GSAP and Three.js. Along the way, I’ve learned the value of
              continuous learning and growth, whether through formal education
              or hands-on project experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve had the privilege of working on a variety of exciting
              projects, from creating apps that automate video promotion for
              businesses to building a platform that connects people with local
              tasks to earn money. I’ve also contributed to a nursing home
              project that aimed to keep families connected with their loved
              ones. My work at LaunchGood, where I serve as a Senior/Lead
              Software Engineer, is another significant milestone in my career.
              In addition to my professional work, I’ve taught hundreds of kids
              and teenagers programming and math, which has been incredibly
              rewarding. Sharing my knowledge and helping others grow has become
              a key part of my journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I’m focusing on building a new online business centered
              around web development services, leveraging my expertise to help
              clients create high-quality websites. I’m also expanding my
              knowledge by delving deeper into the technical aspects of a
              Senior/Lead Software Engineer role, with a goal to master these
              skills and continue progressing in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m driven by the excitement of solving complex problems and
              creating innovative solutions. I find joy in sharing knowledge
              with others, whether it’s through teaching or collaborating with a
              team. I believe in the power of an abundance mindset and in being
              a lifelong learner—there’s always something new to discover, and
              I’m passionate about exploring those opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I want to continue growing both professionally and
              personally. I aim to refine my skills, scale my online business,
              and become an influential voice in the tech community. My ultimate
              goal is to continue creating high-value services, make a positive
              impact, and empower others to reach their full potential.
