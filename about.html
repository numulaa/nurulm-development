              I am a Software Engineer based in Indonesia. I am proficient in
              both Frontend development and Backend development. I have
              extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.Js, MongoDB,
              and React. As a software engineer, I craft robust, scalable
              software with an entrepreneurial mindset and relentless hustle.
              Driven by a passion for innovation, I focus on improving the
              customer experience, shaping the digital landscape one line of
              code at a time.

            <h2>From a high school blogger to a software engineer.</h2>

            <p>Hey there, I'm Nurul. Let me share my journey with you</p>
            <p>
              My love for technology began when I was just three years old. I’d
              watch my dad work on a computer, mesmerized by how clicks and
              keystrokes could make things happen. That fascination grew, and
              eventually, I realized I could make things happen too—starting
              with my own website to share my poetry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The turning point came in 8th grade when I built my first blog. I
              wanted to share my poetry, but instead of waiting for someone to
              give me a platform, I created my own. That’s when I discovered
              coding as a powerful tool that blended creativity and
              problem-solving. In 2018, I dove back into coding while balancing
              school, and I’ve been hooked ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my proudest projects is the Shoplist app I built for my
              family. It solved a recurring problem: my mom forgetting what we
              asked her to buy. From day one, it worked like magic, eliminating
              misunderstandings. That’s the impact I aim for—solving real-world
              problems with simple, meaningful tech.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another defining moment was when I led a project to fund
              scholarships for farmers’ children. We gathered spare coins and
              managed to fund scholarships for three students. It taught me how
              small contributions can create big change.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also contributed to a nursing home project where we built apps
              for the elderly, their families, and administrators. It reminded
              me that while aesthetics are important, true success comes from
              understanding and addressing real user needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              What sets me apart? I combine creativity and storytelling with
              logic and problem-solving. Whether it’s designing user-friendly
              interfaces, seeing things from someone else’s perspective, or
              finding creative solutions, I’m always up for the challenge. Fun
              fact: I’ve competed in poetry slams, and I’m skilled in archery
              and storytelling. You never know when unexpected skills will spark
              the next big idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there’s one thing I want you to remember, it’s this: I’m eager
              to learn, driven to create impact, and committed to delivering
              unexpected value. My goal is for my work to make life easier, more
              joyful, and meaningful for others.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m Nurul Mukhlisa, and I’d love to bring my creativity,
              problem-solving, and passion for technology to your team. Let’s
              create something unforgettable together.
